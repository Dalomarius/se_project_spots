This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This was accomplished by using an inqury called @media a CSS command. This allows to style the webpage to br compatible with any screen size. Another command used to make the web page responsive is "Grid" this allows you to put content into rows and columns and have complete contol of the content and the layout of the webpage. Inherently Grid is responive to different screen sizes that are viewing the webpage so it works really well with @media.
