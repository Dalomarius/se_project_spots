### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This was accomplished by using an inqury called @media a CSS command. This allows to style the webpage to br compatible with any screen size. Another command used to make the web page responsive is "Grid" this allows you to put content into rows and columns and have complete contol of the content and the layout of the webpage. Inherently Grid is responive to different screen sizes that are viewing the webpage so it works really well with @media.

**Figma**

  Figma is such helpful tool when designing a web page. It allows you to gather all the details of the webpage you want to design, like font sizes and distances between webpage content. Basically any detail needed to make your web page fir the design to the Tee.
  **Images**  


The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
